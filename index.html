                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>My passion is game development, but I also find fulfillment 
                    when I am able to use Computer Science in other disciplines. I view my personal
                    studies in CS as the acquisition of a tool I can use in a broad variety of
                    categories to satisfy my endless curiosity and desire to learn. I have the 
                    most experience in graphics and game development, but am always excited to 
                    learn more skills when the opportunity presents itself.

                <h3>Discord Bot for Pokemon Go</h3>
                <p>Created and build a Discord bot using Python over a single weekend that
                    pulled information from an API and used that information to answer queries
                    about Pokemon Go when prompted in Discord.
                </p>
                <h3>Graphics Renderer</h3>
                <p>Created a program in C that took in millions of data points from a file and
                    created frames based off of the data, essentially imitating a GPU. I then used
                    those data points to create a short movie from all of the frames.
                </p>
                <h3>Cube Maze Game</h3>
                <p>For my CS 407 seminar, I was tasked with completing a personal project of my 
                    choosing. I chose to create a maze game using Unity where the use must rotate
                    a cube with a maze on its sides to navigate a ball to an end point. I created 
                    all of the assets and scripts from scratch, and continue to make progress on 
                    it. The project's repo is linked <a href="https://github.com/jordan-grey/Cube-Maze">here.</a>
